I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Specialization course on Coursera.<br/>

# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
## Introduction
The bike-share company Cyclists, in Chicago, wants to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently because they want to design a strategy to increase the annual members.<br/>
As a part of this project, analyzing historical data, I want to answer the question, of whether there is or no difference between those types of users.<br/>
In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.<br/>

## Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step processðŸ“Š. 

1.Ask questions and define the problem.<br/>
2.Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.<br/>
3.Process data by cleaning and checking the information.<br/>
4.Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.<br/>
5.Share data with your audience.<br/>
6.Act on the data and use the analysis results.<br/>

In this notebook I have mentioned the 6 phases.
